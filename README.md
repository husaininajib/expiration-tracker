# Expiration Tracker

The main purpose of this project is to optimize product costs before spoilage occurs, that way reducing spoilage losses and increasing the overall profit margin.

## How this App works?

As the company updates each expiration date inside the application management system it will suggest each item discount the closer they arrive at the expiration date.

### Results

A better management system for the expiration date of each product reduces the spoilage cost and results in an increase on the final profit margin of the company.
